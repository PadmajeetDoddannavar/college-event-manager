# College Event Management System

## Project Overview

This app makes it very easy for the colleges to handle students and events. This app facilitates a student, to register for an event, mark the attendace and feedback. Analytics and Stats Admins have access to the dashboard section, so they'll be able to track how much content contributiors add over a period of time, etc.

This solution is ideal for schools that want to manage events more efficiently and better engage parents, students and staff.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project helped me:

Connect a Flask backend with a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy

Build RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations

Design a responsive and user-friendly interface with Bootstrap

Display dynamic data using Chart.js for interactive dashboards

Handle user input securely and implement basic validation

It also gave me hands-on experience in structuring a web project and documenting it clearly.

## Possible Future Improvements
