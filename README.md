## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project helped me:

Connect a Flask backend with a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy

Build RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations

Design a responsive and user-friendly interface with Bootstrap

Display dynamic data using Chart.js for interactive dashboards

Handle user input securely and implement basic validation

It also gave me hands-on experience in structuring a web project and documenting it clearly.

## Possible Future Improvements

Add authentication with roles for admin and student

Send email notifications for events and updates

Enhance dashboard analytics with more detailed charts

Improve UI/UX with filters and additional interactive elements
